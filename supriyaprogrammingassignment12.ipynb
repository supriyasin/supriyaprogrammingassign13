    "#6. Write a Python program to check order of character in string using OrderedDict()?\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"In this tutorial, we will learn to write a Python program to check the order of characters in a string. \n",
    "   Strings in Python are data types for storing a sequence of characters. For a given string and a pattern, \n",
    "   we have to check if the characters in the string follow the same sequence as the characters in the pattern or not.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Let us look at the sample input and output of the program.\n",

    "  Output: True\n",
    "\n",
    "  Explanation: because according to the pattern 'y' should occur before 's' in the string.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  To execute this task, we can use the OrderedDict() method. First, we have to create an OrderedDict for the given \n",
    "  string where each character will be key. Declare a pointer variable for the start of the pattern and set it at 0. \n",
    "  Then we will match the key (character of the string) with the character in the pattern. If key and character match \n",
    "  with each other then we will increase the counter by 1. If the pointer reaches the end that means the string follows \n",
